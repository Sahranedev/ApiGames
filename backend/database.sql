In the main game mode, two teams of five players compete and the agents use an economical system to buy utility vehicles and weapons. One team is in attack and one is in defense: the attacking team has a bomb that it must place on a site. If it is sufficiently protected and explodes, the attackers gain a point. On the other hand, if the defence team manages to defuse the bomb or if the time is up, they win a point. The elimination of all members of the opposing team also leads to a victory for the tour. The first team to score thirteen points wins the game. A second game mode, Spike Rush, is present and consists of a much faster game, with random weapons and a maximum of seven rounds. Deathmatch, a third game mode, consists of one for oneself where the agent played is random; the goal is no longer to pose or defuse a bomb, but to perform a maximum of eliminations. The first player to get 40 eliminations within 6 minutes wins the game. Finally, Intensification is the latest game mode present and offers shorter games, again by confronting two teams of five players. The principle is to unlock new weapons as the game progresses, with your team. Each elimination advances the team one level, resulting in a change in weapons assigned to players. The first team to complete level 12—or if no team has passed that level after 10 minutes of play, the one that has made the most progress in the levels—is declared the winner.','Samy','Valorant is a free-to-play game that aims to be an all-out competition.

It is primarily developed and published by Nintendo, although some portable installments and re-releases have been outsourced to Capcom, Vanpool, and Grezzo. The gameplay incorporates action-adventure and elements of action RPG games. The series centers on the various incarnations of Link, a courageous young Hylian man, with pointy, elf-like ears; and Princess Zelda, a magical princess who is the mortal reincarnation of the goddess Hylia; as they fight to save the magical land of Hyrule from Ganon, an evil warlord turned demon king, who is the principal antagonist of the series. Ganon wishes to use the Triforce, a sacred relic left behind by the three goddesses that created Hyrule, to remake the world in his own dark image. When gathered together, the power of the Triforce can grant any wish its user desires; however, if someone with a heart that does not possess a balance of the three virtues of Power, Courage, and Wisdom attempts to touch the Triforce, it will split into three triangles and bond with three people whose hearts embody the required virtue. Although their personalities and backstory differ from game to game, the incarnations of Link and Zelda often have many traits in common; such as Link often being left-handed and associated with the color green, while Princess Zelda is often a member of the royal family. While the conflict with Ganon serves as a backbone for the series, some games have featured other settings and antagonists, with Link traveling or being sent to these other lands in their time of need.','Idir','Breath of the Wild was released on Nintendo Switch and Wii U on March 3, 2017.

World of Warcraft, or WoW, is part of the Warcraft franchise, which includes Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness, and Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos. Soon after its release, the game enjoyed a period of tremendous success and popularity among gamers worldwide. Set in the fictional world of Azeroth, WoW allows players to create avatar-style characters and explore a sprawling universe while interacting with nonreal players—called nonplayer characters (NPCs)—and other real-world players (PCs). Various quests, battles, and missions are completed alone or in guilds, and the rewards for success include gold, weapons, and valuable items, which are used to improve one’s character. Characters advance by killing other creatures to earn experience. Once enough experience is acquired, the character gains a level, which increases the character’s powers. WoW offers a rich class system of characters, allowing gamers to play as druids, priests, rogues, paladins, and other fantasy-related classes. Guilds often achieve notoriety for their ability to finish certain quests or defeat specific monsters quickly, and, in this way, a hierarchy system is established in the game.','Jonathan','World of Warcraft is one of the MMORPG that makes players addictive, and that’s understandable!
